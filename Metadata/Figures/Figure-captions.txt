Fig. 1. Map of the study area showing the three locations (Glacier, Burdwood, and Wicklow) where juvenile salmon were monitored for sea louse parasites, as well as the locations of all salmon farms that were active at some point during monitoring from 2001-2015.

Fig. 3. The number of pink salmon (grey) and chum salmon (black) sampled at three locations: (a) Glacier, (b) Burdwood and (c) Wicklow, from 2001 to 2015.

Fig. 4. The sampling window from 2001-2015, showing dates within each year that the three monitoring sites were sampled for juvenile salmon. In recent years, we have aimed to sample weekly for April through May, inclusive (cyan band) to coincide with the period of greatest juvenile pink and salmon outmigration.

Fig. 5. A. Measurements of fork length and, in some years, body depth to the nearest mm were recorded for each salmon. B. We noted damage from, for example, predators. Highlighted with an arrow is a semi-circular scar from a fish predator. C. Pinched belly (PB) occurred when a chalimus-stage louse attached to the ventral surface causing the epidermis to scar and pinch as the fish grows. D. Copepodid- and chalimus-stage lice were identifiable under a 16x hand lens.  Shown here are a copepodid-stage L. salmonis (C, black arrow), and several chalimus-stage lice (species unknown; H, white arrows). The upper two chalimus stage lice have accompanying chalimus scars that would be noted. E. An example of a chalimus scar (CS) from the attachment of chalimus-stage louse (H). Blue blotches can be seen on the dorsal surface. F. An eroded gill (EG) was noted, and if a louse was attached nearby this was accompanied by a comment of a grazed gill place (GGP).  Shown also is a chalimus scar beneath the dorsal fin (CS).

Fig. 6. The relationships among unique columns in the dataset: italic grey words are the unique stages/sex/species that are differentiated in the dataset.  In early years (2001-2006) not all stages/species were distinguished; see text for details.Fig. 7. Pictures of three juvenile salmon showing the presence of "white eye" with a small, cloudy spot in the centre of the eye (a), a larger opaque section (b), and a more severe case where the opaque section covers most of the eye (c). All of these cases would be scored as "1" indicating the presence of white eye.Fig. 8. Example of completed data sheet for sea louse monitoring.  Upon returning to the field station, these data sheets were scanned, and later transcribed into digital format. The cop column has L or C for Lepeoptheirus or Caligus. ChalA and ChalB columns are hash marks for the number of chalimus A and chalimus B stages (no species).  All motile lice are noted in the motile column: pre-adult Lepeoptheirus (PAL), adult Lepeoptheirus (L), gravid Lepeoptheirus (GL), Caligus (C) or gravid Caligus (GC). The notes column has codes for motile scars (MS), predation scars (PS), hemorrhaging (H), eroded gill plate (EG), blue blotches (BB), and scales (SC). Any other information, including the type of predator scar and location of hemorrhaging, is written in the Comments column.

Table 2. Summary of the number of fish examined and the total numbers of lice of each stage/species recorded, as well as the number of fish health observations of each type. Zeroes are color coded to indicate those that are likely missing data (i.e., not recorded for that year; red), true zeroes (green) and unknown (yellow).
